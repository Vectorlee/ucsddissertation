\section{Threat Hunting}
\textit{Threat Hunting} is the process of generating Threat Intelligence
data. It is the beginning of Threat Intelligence data. Data providers 
can generate these data from many different sources, like specially
deployed infrastructures, including honeypot and Internet telescope, or
directly collect from end users, like anti-virus vendors collecting 
potential malicious executable from their customers. However, as one can
imagine, the raw data usually contains a lot of noises and can hardly
serve as meaningful ``intelligence''. Threat hunting aims to use domain 
knowledge and specialized algorithms to detect threat and identify
attackers from the raw data, therefore providing real valuable 
information about different attacks. By definition, this process involves
detecting all possible attacks and covers all detection oriented 
techniques. In this section, I will go through previous research work 
on several representative threat categories and the techniques to detect
them.

\section{Threat Intelligence Sharing}
How much threat one can capture is largely depend on the scope he is
observing on the Internet. Organizations with higher scope of observation,
like bigger Internet telescope or larger number of customers, tend to
capture more threat. However, no entity has the capability to monitor
the entire Internet, and with so many activities going on in the cyber
world these days, each individual entities is only able to monitor a
tiny fraction of what is happening. 

This encouraged \textit{Threat Intelligence Sharing}, where different 
entities collect threat information individually and share the data
with each other, so every one will get a higher coverage on potential 
threat. Many Threat Intelligence providers are offering the platform
for threat intelligence sharing, including IBM X-Force 
Exchange~\cite{ibmxforce}, AlienVault Open Threat 
Exchange~\cite{alienvaultotx}, Facebook 
ThreatExchange~\cite{facebookthreatexchange} etc. These platforms
enable companies (not necessarily security companies), organizations 
or individual security researchers to contribute threat intelligence 
they collected. Companies are also forming alliance and exchange their
intelligence data within the group, like Cyber Threat
Alliance~\cite{cyberthreatalliance}.

One problem during Threat Intelligence sharing is data specification.
Since different entities could collect data in different ways and
also record the data in different format. Without a clear unified
data format, the data being shared will provide little benefit to
the recipients, since they will not be able to understand and utilize
the data. This is a nontrivial task, since this unified data format
has to indicate clearly what does the data ``mean''. If one entity
just shares a list IPs and claims these IPs are malicious IPs, it
does not help much since it is crucial for the recipient to know
exactly why they are malicious, e.g, because they are massively 
scanning the Internet, trying to brute-force log in to SSH servers,
or they serve as C2 servers for malware. Since companies have different 
security hygiene, they will use the data differently based on its
meanings. So it is critical to specify clearly the meaning of the
data during sharing. Because of this, standard Threat Intelligence 
formats have been proposed and developed, 
notably IODEF~\cite{IODEF}, CybOX~\cite{CybOX} and STIX~\cite{STIX}, 
that try to standardize the threat intelligence presentation and sharing.
