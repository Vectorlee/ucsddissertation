\chapter{Background}
\label{chapter:background}

In this chapter, I will go through background knowledge and related work
in all four research directions defined in Chapter~\ref{chapter:introduction}.
More specifically, I first introduce several threat intelligence 
generation techniques in section~\ref{sec:threat_intel_generation}, covering 
different algorithms researchers have explored for each threat category. I
then discuss threat intelligence sharing and its core challenges in Section~\ref{sec:threat_intel_sharing}. The research works discussed in these
two sections belong to the algorithmic research on threat intelligence data. In 
Section~\ref{sec:threat_intel_data}, I discuss previous characteristic studies
on existing threat intelligence feeds. These works fall into the direction of empirical analysis on the data, although they are severely limited in terms of 
scale and lack formal methodologies. Finally, I talk about the usage
of threat intelligence in Section~\ref{sec:threat_intel_uses}, and also
go through previous algorithmic explorations and empirical surveys on the data
usage.

\section{Threat Intelligence Computing}
\label{sec:threat_intel_generation}

\textit{Threat Intelligence Computing} is the process of generating threat 
intelligence data. Cyber-attacks are happening very day on the Internet.
With vantage points, data providers can effectively capture these attacks 
and generate indicator-of-compromises. These vantage points can be specially
deployed infrastructures, including honeypot and Internet telescope; data
providers can also directly collect data from from end-users, like 
anti-virus vendors collecting potential malicious executable from their
customers. 

However, as one can imagine, the raw data usually contains a lot of noises 
and can hardly serve as meaningful ``intelligence''. Threat intelligence 
computing aims to use domain 
knowledge and specialized algorithms to detect threats and identify
attackers from the raw data, therefore providing real valuable 
information about different attacks. By definition, this process involves
detecting all possible attacks and covers all detection oriented 
techniques. In this chapter, I will go through previous research works
on several representative threat categories and discuss the techniques to 
detect these threats. These works fall into the algorithmic direction on
threat intelligence data, base on the definition in 
Chapter~\ref{chapter:introduction}.

\section{Threat Intelligence Sharing}
\label{sec:threat_intel_sharing}

How much cyber-threat one can capture is largely depending on the scope of
vantage points he has on the Internet. Organizations with a larger scope of 
observation,
like bigger Internet telescopes or a larger number of customers, tend to
capture more threats. However, no entity has the capability to monitor
the entire Internet, and with so many activities going on in the cyber
world these days, each individual entity is only able to monitor a
tiny fraction of what is happening. 

This encouraged \textit{Threat Intelligence Sharing}, where different 
entities collect threat information individually and share the data
with each other, so every one will get a higher coverage on potential 
threat. Many threat intelligence providers are offering the platform
for threat intelligence sharing, including IBM X-Force 
Exchange~\cite{ibmxforce}, AlienVault Open Threat 
Exchange~\cite{alienvaultotx}, Facebook 
ThreatExchange~\cite{facebookthreatexchange} etc. These platforms
enable companies (not necessarily security companies), organizations 
or individual security researchers to contribute threat intelligence 
they collected. Companies are also forming alliances and exchange their
intelligence data within the group, like Cyber Threat
Alliance~\cite{cyberthreatalliance}.

One problem during threat intelligence sharing is data specification.
Since different entities could collect data in different ways and
also record the data in different formats. Without a clear unified
data format, the data being shared will provide little benefit to
the recipients, since they will not be able to understand and utilize
the data. This is a nontrivial task, since this unified data format
has to indicate clearly what does the data ``mean''. If one entity
just shares a list IPs and claims these IPs are malicious IPs, it
does not help much since it is crucial for the recipient to know
exactly why they are malicious, e.g, because they are massively 
scanning the Internet, trying to brute-force log in to SSH servers,
or they serve as C2 servers for malware. Since companies have different 
security hygiene, they will use the data differently based on its
meanings. So it is critical to specify clearly the meaning of the
data during sharing. Because of this, standard threat intelligence 
formats have been proposed and developed, 
notably IODEF~\cite{IODEF}, CybOX~\cite{CybOX} and STIX~\cite{STIX}, 
that try to standardize the threat intelligence presentation and sharing.
