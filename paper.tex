In recognition of reading this manual before beginning to format the
doctoral dissertation or master's thesis; for following the
instructions written herein; for consulting with OGS Academic Affairs
Advisers; and for not relying on other completed manuscripts, this
manual is dedicated to all graduate students about to complete the
doctoral dissertation or master's thesis.

In recognition that this is my one chance to use whichever
justification, spacing, writing style, text size, and/or textfont that
I want to while still keeping my headings and margins consistent.

\noindent Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for
writers palliate the writer's loneliness, but I doubt if they improve
his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and
often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a
good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.

Almost nothing is said in the manual about the preface. There is no
indication about how it is to be typeset. Given that, one is forced to
simply typeset it and hope it is accepted. It is, however, optional
and may be omitted.

\chapter{An ordinary page}
The purpose of this page is to illustrate an ordinary page of text in
a doctoral dissertation or master's thesis. All pages of the doctoral
dissertation or master's thesis must be kept within the margins of
1.5'' on the left, 1'' on the right, 1'' on the top and 1.25'' on the
bottom. All text must be double spaced except as indicated below.

It is recommended that to increase the margins as paper can shift in a
printer and as some photocopiers tend to increase the image being
copied.

The first line of each paragraph must be indented at least one 0.5''
tab, as done here.

This text is intended to be a part of the dissertation, for a doctoral
student, or the thesis if you are receiving a master's degree, and now
a quote is included here:
\begin{quote}
All quotes of more than six lines, even though this one is not, are to
be indented 0.5'' from the left and 0.5'' from the right. These longer
quotes are to be single spaced. Don't forget to adjust for proper
spacing after the last line of the quoted material.
\end{quote}
The rest of the paragraph would continue as so.

\chapter{Figures and Such}
This demonstrates how OGS wants figures and tables formatted. For
figures, the caption goes below the figure and ``Figure'' is in bold.
See Figure~\ref{fig:zen}. Tables are formatted with the caption above
the table. See Table~\ref{tab:bad}.

Of course, Table~\ref{tab:bad} looks horrible. It should probably be
formatted like Table~\ref{tab:good} instead.

For facing caption pages, see Table~\ref{tab:facing}. Of course,
facing caption pages are vaguely ridiculous and my implementation of
them in the class file is by far the most brittle part of the
implementation. It's entirely possible that something has changed and
these don't work at all. I implemented it merely for the challenge.

\emph{Notes}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The counts shown below will differ from the official quarterly
Registrar's registration report because 1) data for residents in the
Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science are
excluded, and 2) registered, non-matriculated, visiting students are
included.
\item Student workers are excluded from employees; however emeritus
faculty and others on recall status are included.
