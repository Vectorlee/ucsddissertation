As a final analysis, I explore the consistency of reflector blocking
behavior at a coarser granularity.  A common use case of blacklists is
at the granularity of an organization, often via some kind of network
appliance.  In such a scenario, I would expect the blocking behavior
of {\reflectors} to be consistent across an organization: if one
{\reflector} blocks a blacklist IP, then other {\reflectors} in the
same organization should also block it.

Ideally I would like to map reflectors to organizations to answer
this question.  However, mapping an IP to an organization is a
challenging problem, particularly with the increasing use of WHOIS
anonymization.  Instead, I use the common, more tractable technique
of aggregating reflectors by their /24 prefix.  As a result, in this
section I answer a methodological question: If I aggregate
reflectors by their /24 prefix, do the aggregated reflectors exhibit
consistent blocking behavior?  Is the /24 prefix aggregation a useful
proxy for expected consistent blocking by organizations?

My data set has 134,370 {\reflectors} that are part of /24s with more
than one {\reflector}.  For each blacklist, I categorize the blocking
behavior of multiple {\reflectors} in the same /24 into one of three
categories: \textit{consistent}, \textit{almost consistent}, and
\textit{inconsistent}.  I define a /24 to be ``consistent'' for a
blacklist if \textit{all} the individual {\reflectors} in that /24
block the \textit{exact same} blacklist IPs.
%
A /24 is ``almost consistent'' if the blocking behavior of the
{\reflectors} in a /24 differs only by one IP. For example, a /24 is
``almost consistent'' if it has four {\reflectors}, three of which
block the same 21 IPs from a blacklist, and the fourth {\reflector}
blocks 20 out the same 21 IPs.
Finally, I consider all other /24s ``inconsistent''.


Using these definitions, Table~\ref{tab:consistency-breakdown} shows
the consistency results for all the /24s that have more than one
{\reflector}. The results are dominated by /24s that do not show any
blocking behavior.  I consider such /24s consistent since all the
hosts under these /24s block the same number (zero) of blacklist IPs,
but these cases also do not provide much insight.

Excluding the ``no blocking'' cases, then in the presence of any
blocking, consistency of blocking behavior at a /24 granularity is far
from guaranteed.  As discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:fpfn_analysis},
the measurement technique has very low false positive and false
negative rates.  Measurement error can potentially explain some
``almost consistent'' cases and perhaps some ``inconsistent'' cases,
too.  However, the consistency results for the control group,
comprised of 20 randomly sampled US IPs
(Section~\ref{sec:perfect-blocking}), shows that the potential effect
of measurement error on consistency is small.  In other words, the
inconsistent cases do indeed demonstrate different blocking behavior
among hosts within the same /24.

One situation that could lead to inconsistent blocking behavior within
a /24 is when the network belongs to a cloud or hosting provider, and
the IPs within the same /24 are used by distinct entities.  For
instance, when manually examining the inconsistent /24s for {\bdsatif}
(which has the highest inconsistency), I found more than 60\% of
these /24s belong to cloud or hosting providers.  Another situation
leading to inconsistent block behavior is when a /24 belongs to an ISP
which sub-allocates IP addresses to different customers.

In summary, the results indicate that one can not assume consistent
blocking behavior for {\reflectors} in the same /24 network.
