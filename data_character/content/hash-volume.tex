\subsection{Volume}

File hashes, unlike IP threat data, are not transient---a file does
not change from malicious to benign---and thus a far simpler volume
analysis is appropriate. We report volume as the number of new hashes
that are added to each feed during our measurement period.

As seen in Table~\ref{tab:md5-volume-1}, we examine each feed's volume and
average daily rate. Like IP feeds, file hash feeds also vary dramatically in
volume. The majority of the hashes are concentrated in three feeds: FB Malware,
PA Malware Indicators, and PA Analyst, which also exhibit the highest daily rates.
The other feeds are multiple order of magnitude smaller comparatively.

%Every feed has mostly exclusive content, with the ``lowest'' exclusivity belonging to PA Twitter Emotet and PA OSINT (still 77.6\% and 79.29\%, respectively). All other feeds showcase a >97\% exclusive percentage, demonstrating that most MD5 feeds are distinct from each other.
